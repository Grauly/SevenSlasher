# Seven Slasher
Ever ran into the problem of forgetting to press shift while using msg to transfer state secrets, and it ended up in public chat?
Well you have come to the right place! This simple mod converts any of those accidents into viable commands. And for the chance you actually want to start your message with a 7, just escape it with a \\

## Examples
`7msg contact secret message = /msg contact secret message`


`\7 things need to be done = 7 things need to be done`
